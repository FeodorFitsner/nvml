Linux NVM Library

This is win/README.

This directory contains the Windows-specific source for the NVM Library.

The subdirectory "include" contains header files that ...
get delivered
along with the libraries.  Everything else is internal to the libraries
and lives in this directory.

See the top-level README for build, test, and installation instructions.
The basic "make" and "make test" targets also work from this directory.
