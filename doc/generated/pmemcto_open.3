.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmemobj_open\f[]() function opens an existing close\-to\-open
persistence memory pool, returning a memory pool handle used with most
of the \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] functions.
\f[I]path\f[] must be an existing file containing a pmemcto memory pool
as created by \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]().
If \f[I]layout\f[] is non\-NULL, it is compared to the layout name
provided to \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() when the pool was first created.
This can be used to verify the layout of the pool matches what was
expected.
The application must have permission to open the file and memory map it
with read/write permissions.
If an error prevents the pool from being opened, or if the given
\f[I]layout\f[] does not match the pool\[aq]s layout,
\f[B]pmemcto_open\f[]() returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[]
appropriately.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() function creates a close\-to\-open
persistence pool with the given total \f[I]poolsize\f[].
The resulting pool is then used with functions like
\f[B]pmemcto_malloc\f[](3) and \f[B]pmemcto_free\f[](3) to provide the
familiar \f[I]malloc\-like\f[] programming model for the memory pool.
\f[I]path\f[] specifies the name of the memory pool file to be created.
\f[I]layout\f[] specifies the application\[aq]s layout type in the form
of a string.
The layout name is not interpreted by \f[B]libpmemcto\f[], but may be
used as a check when \f[B]pmemcto_open\f[]() is called.
The layout name, including the terminating null byte (\[aq]\[aq]),
cannot be longer than \f[B]PMEMCTO_MAX_LAYOUT\f[] as defined in
\f[B]<libpmemcto.h>\f[].
It is allowed to pass NULL as \f[I]layout\f[], which is equivalent for
using an empty string as a layout name.
\f[I]mode\f[] specifies the permissions to use when creating the file as
described by \f[B]creat\f[](2).
The memory pool file is fully allocated to the size \f[I]poolsize\f[]
using \f[B]posix_fallocate\f[](3).
The caller may choose to take responsibility for creating the memory
pool file by creating it before calling \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() and
then specifying \f[I]poolsize\f[] as zero.
In this case \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() will take the pool size from the
size of the existing file and will verify that the file appears to be
empty by searching for any non\-zero data in the pool header at the
beginning of the file.
The minimum file size allowed by the library for a local close\-to\-open
memory pool is defined in \f[B]<libpmemcto.h>\f[] as
\f[B]PMEMCTO_MIN_POOL\f[].
.PP
Depending on the configuration of the system, the available space of
non\-volatile memory space may be divided into multiple memory devices.
In such case, the maximum size of the pmemcto memory pool could be
limited by the capacity of a single memory device.
The \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] allows building close\-to\-open memory pool
spanning multiple memory devices by creation of persistent memory pools
consisting of multiple files, where each part of such a \f[I]pool
set\f[] may be stored on different pmem\-aware filesystem.
.PP
Creation of all the parts of the pool set can be done with the
\f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() function.
However, the recommended method for creating pool sets is to do it by
using the \f[B]pmempool\f[](1) utility.
.PP
When creating the pool set consisting of multiple files, the
\f[I]path\f[] argument passed to \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() must point to
the special \f[I]set\f[] file that defines the pool layout and the
location of all the parts of the pool set.
The \f[I]poolsize\f[] argument must be 0.
The meaning of \f[I]layout\f[] and \f[I]mode\f[] arguments doesn\[aq]t
change, except that the same \f[I]mode\f[] is used for creation of all
the parts of the pool set.
If the error prevents any of the pool set files from being created,
\f[B]pmemblk_create\f[]() returns NULL and sets \f[I]errno\f[]
appropriately.
.PP
When opening the pool set consisting of multiple files, the
\f[I]path\f[] argument passed to \f[B]pmemcto_open\f[]() must not point
to the pmemcto memory pool file, but to the same \f[I]set\f[] file that
was used for the pool set creation.
If an error prevents any of the pool set files from being opened, or if
the actual size of any file does not match the corresponding part size
defined in \f[I]set\f[] file \f[B]pmemcto_open\f[]() returns NULL and
sets \f[I]errno\f[] appropriately.
.PP
The set file is a plain text file, which must start with the line
containing a \f[I]PMEMPOOLSET\f[] string, followed by the specification
of all the pool parts in the next lines.
For each part, the file size and the absolute path must be provided.
.PP
The size has to be compliant with the format specified in IEC 80000\-13,
IEEE 1541 or the Metric Interchange Format.
Standards accept SI units with obligatory B \- kB, MB, GB, ...
(multiplier by 1000) and IEC units with optional "iB" \- KiB, MiB, GiB,
..., K, M, G, ...
\- (multiplier by 1024).
.PP
The path of a part can point to a Device DAX and in such case the size
argument can be set to an "AUTO" string, which means that the size of
the device will be automatically resolved at pool creation time.
When using Device DAX there\[aq]s also one additional restriction \- it
is not allowed to concatenate more than one Device DAX device in a
single pool set if the configured internal alignment is other than 4KiB.
In such case a pool set can consist only of a single part (single Device
DAX).
Please see \f[B]ndctl\-create\-namespace\f[](1) for information on how
to configure desired alignment on Device DAX.
.PP
Device DAX is the device\-centric analogue of Filesystem DAX.
It allows memory ranges to be allocated and mapped without need of an
intervening file system.
For more information please see \f[B]ndctl\-create\-namespace\f[](1).
.PP
The minimum file size of each part of the pool set is the same as the
minimum size allowed for a block pool consisting of one file.
It is defined in \f[B]<libpmemcto.h>\f[] as \f[B]PMEMCTO_MIN_POOL\f[].
Lines starting with "#" character are ignored.
.PP
Here is the example "myctopool.set" file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
100G\ /mountpoint0/myfile.part0
200G\ /mountpoint1/myfile.part1
400G\ /mountpoint2/myfile.part2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The files in the set may be created by running the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ pmempool\ create\ cto\ \-l\ "mylayout"\ myctopool.set
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_close\f[]() function closes the memory pool indicated
by \f[I]pcp\f[] and deletes the memory pool handle.
The close\-to\-open memory pool itself lives on in the file that
contains it and may be re\-opened at a later time using
\f[B]pmemcto_open\f[]() as described above.
If the pool was not closed gracefully due to abnormal program
termination or power failure, the pool is in an inconsistent state
causing subsequent pool opening to fail.
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_check\f[]() function performs a consistency check of
the file indicated by \f[I]path\f[] and returns 1 if the memory pool is
found to be consistent.
Any inconsistencies found will cause \f[B]pmemcto_check\f[]() to return
0, in which case the use of the file with \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] will
result in undefined behavior.
The debug version of \f[B]libpmemcto\f[] will provide additional details
on inconsistencies when \f[B]PMEMCTO_LOG_LEVEL\f[] is at least 1, as
described in the \f[B]DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING\f[] section of
\f[B]pmemcto\f[](3).
\f[B]pmemcto_check\f[]() will return \-1 and set \f[I]errno\f[] if it
cannot perform the consistency check due to other errors.
\f[B]pmemcto_check\f[]() opens the given \f[I]path\f[] read\-only so it
never makes any changes to the file.
This function is not supported on Device DAX.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, the \f[B]pmemcto_open\f[]() and \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]()
functions return a memory pool handle, or NULL if an error occured (in
which case \f[I]errno\f[] is set appropriately).
.PP
The \f[B]pmemcto_check\f[]() returns 1 if the memory pool is found to be
consistent, and 0 otherwise.
If it cannot perform the consistency check \-1 is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
\f[B]EINVAL\f[] "layout" string does not match the layout stored in pool
header.

\f[B]PMEMCTO_MAX_LAYOUT\f[].

.PP
\f[B]EINVAL\f[] \f[I]path\f[] passed to \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() points

.PP
\f[B]EINVAL\f[] \f[I]path\f[] passed to \f[B]pmemcto_create\f[]() points

.PP
\f[B]EINVAL\f[] Invalid format of the pool set file.
.PP
\f[B]EINVAL\f[] Invalid pool header.
.PP
\f[B]EAGAIN\f[] pmemcto pool is already open.
.PP
\f[B]EACCES\f[] No write access permission to the pool file(s).

.SH BUGS
.PP
Unlike \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](3), data replication is not supported in
\f[B]libpmemcto\f[].
Thus, it is not allowed to specify replica sections in pool set files.
