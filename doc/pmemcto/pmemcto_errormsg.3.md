# NAME #

pmemcto_errormsg -- return string describing last error


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemcto.h>

const char *pmemcto_errormsg(void);

```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmemcto_errormsg**() function returns a pointer to a static buffer
containing the last error message logged for current thread.
The error message may include description of the corresponding error code
(if *errno* was set), as returned by **strerror**(3).
The error message buffer is thread-local; errors encountered in one thread
do not affect its value in other threads.  The buffer is never cleared by any
library function; its content is significant only when the return value of
the immediately preceding call to **libpmemcto** function indicated an error,
or if *errno* was set.  The application must not modify or free the error
message string, but it may be modified by subsequent calls to other library
functions.


# RETURN VALUE #

The **pmemcto_errormsg**() function returns a pointer to a string that
describes the last error encountered by **libpmemcto** for current thread.


# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS #

**libpmemcto** depends on jemalloc, written by Jason Evans, to do the heavy
lifting of managing dynamic memory allocation. See:
<http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc>

**libpmemcto** builds on the persistent memory programming model recommended
by the SNIA NVM Programming Technical Work Group:
<http://snia.org/nvmp>
