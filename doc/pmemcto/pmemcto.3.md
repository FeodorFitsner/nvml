# NAME #

**libpmemcto** -- close-to-open persistence


# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmemcto.h>

cc ... -std=gnu99 -lpmemcto -lpmem
```

# DESCRIPTION #

**libpmemcto** is a Persistent Memory allocator with no overhead imposed by
run-time flushing or transactional updates:

+ It runs at traditional **volatile** memory allocator speeds - there is
  no flushing or consistency check at run-time.

+ An overhead imposed only when program exits normally and have to flush
  the file.

+ The program flushes the pool contents when it exits, and then rebuilds
  the pool on the next run.

+ If the program crashes before flushing the file (or if flushing fails),
  the pool is in an inconsistent state causing subsequent pool opening to fail.

**libpmemcto** provides common *malloc-like* interfaces to memory pools
built on memory-mapped files.  These interfaces are for traditional
**volatile** memory allocation but, unlike the functions described
in **malloc**(3), the memory managed by **libpmemcto** may have different
attributes, depending on the file system containing the memory-mapped files.

**libpmemcto** uses the **mmap**(2) system call to create a pool
of persistent memory.  The library is most useful when used with
*Direct Access* storage (DAX), which is memory-addressable persistent storage
that supports load/store access without being paged via the system page cache.
A Persistent Memory-aware file system is typically used to provide this type
of access.  Memory-mapping a file from a Persistent Memory-aware file system
provides the raw memory pools, and this library supplies the more familiar
*malloc-like* interfaces on top of those pools.

Under normal usage, **libpmemcto** will never print messages or intentionally
cause the process to exit.  Exceptions to this are prints caused by calls to
**pmemcto_stats_print**(3), or by enabling debugging as described under
**DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING** below.  The library uses **pthreads**(7)
to be fully MT-safe, but never creates or destroys threads itself.
The library does not make use of any signals, networking, and never calls
**select**() or **poll**().

The system memory allocation routines like **malloc**() and **free**()
are used by **libpmemcto** for managing a small amount of run-time state,
but applications are allowed to override these calls if necessary
(see **pmemcto_set_funcs**(3)).

This library builds on the low-level pmem support provided by **libpmem**(3).


# MANAGING MEMORY POOLS #

To use **libpmemcto**, a *memory pool* is first created.  This is most commonly
done with the **pmemcto_create**(3) function.
The **pmemobj_open**(3) function opens an existing close-to-open persistence
memory pool.

Once created or opened, a memory pool is represented by an opaque pool handle,
of type *PMEMctopool\**, which is passed to the functions for memory allocation
described in **pmemcto_malloc**(3), **pmemcto_memalign**(3),
**pmemcto_strdup**(3) and **pmemcto_wcsdup**(3).


# MANAGING LIBRARY BEHAVIOR #

The library entry points described in this section are less commonly used.
These entry points expose library information or alter the default library
behavior.

```c
const char *pmemcto_check_version(
	unsigned major_required,
	unsigned minor_required);
```

The **pmemcto_check_version**() function is used to see if the installed
**libpmemcto** supports the version of the library API required by
an application.  The easiest way to do this is for the application to supply
the compile-time version information, supplied by defines
in **\<libpmemcto.h\>**, like this:

```c
reason = pmemcto_check_version(PMEMCTO_MAJOR_VERSION,
                            PMEMCTO_MINOR_VERSION);
if (reason != NULL) {
	/* version check failed, reason string tells you why */
}
```

Any mismatch in the major version number is considered a failure, but a library
with a newer minor version number will pass this check since increasing minor
versions imply backwards compatibility.

An application can also check specifically for the existence of an interface
by checking for the version where that interface was introduced. These versions
are documented in this man page as follows: unless otherwise specified,
all interfaces described here are available in version 1.0 of the library.
Interfaces added after version 1.0 will contain the text *introduced
in version x.y* in the section of this manual describing the feature.

When the version check performed by **pmemcto_check_version**() is successful,
the return value is NULL. Otherwise the return value is a static string
describing the reason for failing the version check.
The string returned by **pmemcto_check_version**() must not be modified or freed.

```c
void pmemcto_set_funcs(
	void *(*malloc_func)(size_t size),
	void (*free_func)(void *ptr),
	void *(*realloc_func)(void *ptr, size_t size),
	char *(*strdup_func)(const char *s),
	void (*print_func)(const char *s));
```

The **pmemcto_set_funcs**() function allows an application to override some
interfaces used internally by **libpmemcto**. Passing in NULL for any of
the handlers will cause the **libpmemcto** default function to be used.
The library does not make heavy use of the system malloc functions, but it does
allocate approximately 4-8 kilobytes for each memory pool in use.
The only functions in the malloc family used by the library are represented
by the first four arguments to **pmemcto_set_funcs**().  The *print_func*
function is called by **libpmemcto** when the **pmemcto_stats_print**(3)
entry point is used, or when additional tracing is enabled in the debug version
of the library as described in the **DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING** section
below.  The default *print_func* used by the library prints to the file
specified by the **PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE** environment variable, or to *stderr*
if that variable is not set.


# DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING #

Two versions of **libpmemcto** are typically available on a development system.
The normal version, accessed when a program is linked using the **-lpmemcto**
option, is optimized for performance.  That version skips checks that impact
performance and never logs any trace information or performs any
run-time assertions.  If an error is detected during the call to **libpmemcto**
function, an application may retrieve an error message describing the reason
of failure using the function **pmemcto_errormsg**(3).

A second version of **libpmemcto**, accessed when a program uses the libraries
under **/usr/lib/nvml_debug**, contains run-time assertions and trace points.
The typical way to access the debug version is to set the environment variable
**LD_LIBRARY_PATH** to **/usr/lib/nvml_debug** or **/usr/lib64/nvml_debug**
depending on where the debug libraries are installed on the system.
The trace points in the debug version of the library are enabled using
the environment variable **PMEMCTO_LOG_LEVEL**, which can be set to the
following values:

+ **0** - This is the default level when **PMEMCTO_LOG_LEVEL** is not set.
  Only statistics are logged, and then only in response to a call
  to **pmemcto_stats_print**().

+ **1** - Additional details on any errors detected are logged (in addition
  to returning the *errno*-based errors as usual). The same information may be
  retrieved using **pmemcto_errormsg**(3).

+ **2** - A trace of basic operations including allocations and deallocations
  is logged.

+ **3** - This level enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing
  in the library.

+ **4** - This level enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing information
  that is likely only useful to the **libpmemcto** developers.

The environment variable **PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE** specifies a file name where all
logging information should be written.  If the last character in the name
is "-", the PID of the current process will be appended to the file name when
the log file is created. If **PMEMCTO_LOG_FILE** is not set, output goes
to *stderr*.  All prints are done using the *print_func* function
in **libpmemcto** (see **pmemcto_set_funcs**(3) for details on how to override
that function).

Setting the environment variable **PMEMCTO_LOG_LEVEL** has no effect
on the non-debug version of **libpmemcto**.


# BUGS #

Unlike **libpmemobj**(3), data replication is not supported in **libpmemcto**.
Thus, it is not allowed to specify replica sections in pool set files.


# NOTES #

Unlike the normal **malloc**(), which asks the system for additional
memory when it runs out, **libpmemcto** allocates the size it is told
to and never attempts to grow or shrink that memory pool.


# EXAMPLE #

The following example creates a memory pool, allocates some memory
to contain the string "hello, world", and then frees that memory.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <libpmemcto.h>

/* size of the pmemcto pool -- 1 GB */
#define POOL_SIZE ((size_t)(1 << 30))

/* name of our layout in the pool */
#define LAYOUT_NAME "example_layout"

struct root {
	char *str;
	char *data;
};

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	const char path[] = "/pmem-fs/myfile";
	PMEMctopool *pcp;

	/* create the pmemcto pool or open it if already exists */
	pcp = pmemcto_create(path, LAYOUT_NAME, POOL_SIZE, 0666);

	if (pcp == NULL)
		pcp = pmemcto_open(path, LAYOUT_NAME);

	if (pcp == NULL) {
		perror(path);
		exit(1);
	}

	/* get the root object pointer */
	struct root *rootp = pmemcto_get_root_pointer(pcp);

	if (rootp == NULL) {
		/* allocate root object */
		rootp = pmemcto_malloc(pcp, sizeof(*rootp));

		if (rootp == NULL) {
			perror(pmemcto_errormsg());
			exit(1);
		}

		/* save the root object pointer */
		pmemcto_set_root_pointer(pcp, rootp);

		rootp->str = pmemcto_strdup(pcp, "Hello World!");
		rootp->data = NULL;
	}

	/* ... */

	pmemcto_close(pcp);
}
```
